Text Translator Web App

Overview

The Text Translator Web App is a Spring Boot-based web application designed to translate text into different languages. The application exposes a REST API that will eventually leverage Google Cloud Translation API for high-quality translations.

Status

‚úÖ Spring Boot backend setup

‚úÖ REST API endpoint created

‚è≥ Google Cloud Translation API integration pending (Reason: Google Cloud Premium account required)

Features (Implemented & Planned)

‚úÖ Implemented Features:

REST API with Spring Boot

Basic endpoint to handle translation requests (currently placeholder logic)

üîú Planned Features:

Integration with Google Cloud Translation API for actual translation

Improved error handling and validation

Frontend (optional, if necessary)

API Endpoints

The text to translate

targetLanguage

The language code (e.g., es for Spanish)

Response (Current Placeholder):

  "translatedText": "Translation placeholder"
}

Pending Integration: Google Cloud Translation API

I plan to integrate Google Cloud Translation API to provide real-time, accurate translations. However, this integration requires a Google Cloud Premium account, which is currently unavailable due to payment issues.

Next Steps

Obtain a Google Cloud Premium account

Implement API integration with Google Cloud Translation

Add unit tests and improve error handling
